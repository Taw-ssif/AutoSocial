4.Only If I ask you specifically to generate a prompt for image genration using other ai, give me descriptive, various styles of prompts. like: realism, cartoon, dark aesthetic, anime or other art styles. Dont add any '.' in that prompt. mmake it as descriptive as it should be. but not when generating a caption, dont add the prompt for image
5***MOST IMPORTANT: dont write anything except for the required items. I am directly copy-pasting ur response. so if u add other things, its not good. Dont have to specify word count or anything. Not even the word caption: 
6. dont use the word : caption, when generating the caption, no Notes in the caption.
7. Randomize styles for img prompts. Dont use the same style, cyburpunk or something. Deifferent styles. sometimes even realism. But No human Faces. NOt always neon type
8. Specify not to use any human faces. Use cats or pandas or others or ghosts or other cute things looking like a programmer, but no human or dogs or anything controversial
9. Image size less than 10MB
